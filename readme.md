#Frontend LevelUp 2020
Daftcode web courses project

### Installation
In order to correctly set up the project, clone the repository & run `npm install`.

### Usage
To run the project run `npm start`. This will call webpack in watch mode and will redirect user to `http://localhost:3000`.

Due to __browsersync__ included to the project, each change in source files will result in browser refresh.

Currently each change will also product distribution files (`/docs`) used for [Live](https://kkosmowski.github.io/frontend-level-up/).
This is planned to be changed in future to create _dist build_ with `npm run build` only.
